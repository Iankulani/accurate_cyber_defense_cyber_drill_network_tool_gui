Accurate Cyber Defense Cyber Drill Network Tool GUI is an advanced, user-friendly platform designed for simulating cyber drills and improving network security operations.


Developed for both military and government agencies, this tool enables security teams to practice responding to real-world cyber threats, fine-tune their incident response procedures, and enhance their overall cyber resilience.

Built with a clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), the platform empowers analysts of all skill levels to quickly configure, monitor, and visualize cyber drill exercises. 
The dashboard displays real-time network data and provides interactive visualizations — such as pie charts, bar graphs, and timelines — making complex network information easier to interpret. 
Users can also configure custom IP address ranges, protocols, and scenarios, allowing realistic training environments for different types of attacks, including DDoS, phishing, brute force attempts, and network infiltration.

In addition to real-time drill monitoring, the tool offers automated data recording and reporting features. 
Every drill session can be logged and exported in common file formats (CSV, JSON, TXT), allowing teams to review performance post-exercise and identify areas for improvement. 
The system supports detailed packet analysis and protocol filtering, making it highly valuable for hands-on practice for military cybersecurity teams or government 
IT security departments preparing for nation-state-level cyber incidents.

Whether you’re running small in-house security exercises or large-scale inter-agency cyber simulations, the Accurate Cyber Defense Cyber Drill Network Tool GUI equips your team with the robust capabilities they need. 
Deploy this software to establish a practice environment, visualize cyber threats in real time, enhance detection accuracy, and build the muscle memory that is critical when under cyber attack.

This repository contains the full source code, documentation, and setup instructions — making it easy to integrate into your existing cyber defense strategy. 
Designed for scalability and flexibility, this is an essential tool for cyber defense drills at any level.
